## Lab

## Add JOINS

Normalize your existing data. If you don't have another "table", find or add a property to your entity
that requires a lookup field.

1. Change your database schema and update your scripts
1. Add a script to seed your "lookup data"
1. Add a JOIN to your `GET` list select
    * Keep the detail view get as just the id
1. Add a `GET` for the lookup values

## Full CRUD

Add Full CRUD for your resource:

1. Make sure you have delete and update!

## BONUS

Create app pages and server routes for maintaining lookup table

## Rubric
