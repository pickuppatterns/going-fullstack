## Lab

### Transational FullStack 

Final Lab needs to handle:

* `C`reate - Add a resource
* `R`ead list - All resources in list view
* `R`ead id - Resource detail view
* `U`pdate - Update a resource
* `D`elete - Remove a resource

The reosource needs to have an attribute (property) that is a 
foreign key to another resource (usually a lookup value). This needs to
be correctly managed in other operations (choose a value in add/update, 
display value in list and detail).
